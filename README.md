# Vistrates Framework and Packages

Vistrates is an extension to [Codestrates](https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates). It provides additonal features for visualization and data analytics, which can be easily added to or removed. But first remember to install the Vistrates package, which contains the core framework, on a codestrate to create a vistrate.

## Installation

To use Vistrates you need to setup a [codestrate](http://codestrates.org) first. Refer to the [Codestrates GitHub repository](https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates) for instructions on how to set one up. 

### Installing and Updating Packages

Selecting the _Install and Update Packages_ entry in the menu will open a dialog, where one can select packages to install or update.

### Pushing Packages

When developing new packages or modifying existing packages, the packages can be pushed to another vistrate (e.g. the _Vistrate-Packages_ vistrate). This is done by using the _Push Packages_ entry in the menu.

### Removing Packages

Removing packages is done by selecting the _Remove Packages_ entry in the menu. It will open a dialog, where one can select the packages, that should be removed from a vistrate.

**Hint**: Packages section should not just be deleted but removed using the dialog.

## Disclaimer

Vistrates is a research prototype in active development. Many features are still experimental and yet to be properly documented.
