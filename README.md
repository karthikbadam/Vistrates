# Vistrates Framework and Packages

Vistrates is an extension to [Codestrates](https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates). It provides features for visualization and data analytics in the form of components, which can be easily added or removed. But, first remember to install the Vistrates package, which contains the core framework, on a codestrate to turn it into a vistrate.

## Installation

To use Vistrates you need to setup a [codestrate](http://codestrates.org) first. Refer to the [Codestrates GitHub repository](https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates) for instructions on how to set one up. 

### Installing and Updating Packages

Selecting the _Install and Update Packages_ entry in the menu will open a dialog, where one can select packages to install or update.

### Pushing Packages

When developing new packages or modifying existing packages, the packages can be pushed to another vistrate (e.g. the _Vistrate-Packages_ vistrate). This is done by using the _Push Packages_ entry in the menu.

### Removing Packages

Removing packages is done by selecting the _Remove Packages_ entry in the menu. It will open a dialog, where one can select the packages, that should be removed from a vistrate.

**Hint**: Packages section should not just be deleted but removed using the dialog.

## Disclaimer

Vistrates is a research prototype in active development. Many features are still experimental and yet to be properly documented.
